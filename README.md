This code is tested on Windows 11 and with Java 17.

To run it up, build the codebase into a JAR using Java 17 (or just go in the app folder, there's the latest version of the project already built into a JAR in it), and use the following command : 
```bash
java -jar <jar_name>.jar input.txt
``` 

Edge cases were dealt with when expectations were given. 

If your input doesn't respect the same conventions as the examples given, it WILL NOT work.

Actually a really fun challenge !
